# Node Application

## Install
Ensure you have node and npm installed.

Once you have node and npm go to `client` and run
`npm install`
once you've done that you can run
`npm start`
That will start the react development server.
However, if you want to run it with the server run
`npm run build`
After that cd back to the root of the NodeApp and run
`npm install`
`node index.js`
