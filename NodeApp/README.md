# Node Application

## Install
Ensure you have node and npm installed.

Then inside of NodeApp run
`npm install`
follwed by going to client and running
`npm install`

After that return to NodeApp and then you can either build the app or start a dev server.

### Building
After installing you can go to NodeApp and run
`npm start`
There should then be a `build` folder with the built project. You could then cd into there and run 
`node index.mjs`

### Development Server
After installing you can go to the NodeApp and run
```
npm run dev
```
It should then start the dev server. A few notes, the client will hot reload, but server changes will not hot reload.
