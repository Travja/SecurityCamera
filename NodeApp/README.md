# Node Application

## Install
Ensure you have node and npm installed. *The project was built with node 14+.

Navigate to the repositories base directory and execute the following:
```sh
# The start script runs 'npm i' in the current directory
# as well as in the 'client' directory
cd NodeApp
npm start
```

This script compiles all the code and (by default) starts a *production deployment of the server. You may terminate this process in order to start a development server. In most cases, `npm start` should be sufficient to startup and run the server.

### Development Server
After installing you can go to the NodeApp and run
```
npm run dev
```
It should then start the dev server. A few notes, the client will hot reload, but server changes will not hot reload.
