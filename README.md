[NodeApp](https://github.com/Travja/SecurityCamera/blob/main/NodeApp/README.md)

The overview of using this application is first starting the client application. It will host it's stream and notify the server of it.
The server then hosts a web application and then the user will be able to login and view their camera streams and recordings it has.
